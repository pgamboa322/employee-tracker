# Employee Tracker

A simple and easy to use employee manager app that helps track, add, and update all your employees through a terminal interface with the help of Inquirer.

## Installation

Download or clone repo, npm install, node js.

## Usage

You will have two terminals (bash & mysql)

In mysql terminal
mysql -u root -p

You will be prompted with a password -- enter in root (all lowercase)

now you will use your sql files 

1. source db/db.sql
2. source db/schema.sql
3. source db/seeds.sql

If you want to make sure that your table is there then you can run  

SHOW TABLES;

Now switch over to your bash terminal

you will run node index.js

Then be prompted through the CL application. 

** When you get to add  employee just start typing  and it  will  show the right prompt for "first name". It is a weird glitch.
